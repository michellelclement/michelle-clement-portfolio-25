openingText: Periods are rarely discussed, especially in the workplace, leading to stigma and a lack of support. A staggering 89% of people who menstruate report anxiety or stress at work due to their periods, and 63% say normalizing conversations could help. Recognizing how the menstrual cycle impacts creativity, mental health, and well-being, we launched a campaign to challenge taboos and foster understanding.
mainText: The campaign began with a virtual conversation to make people more comfortable talking about periods. We surveyed 20 people without periods and 60 with periods to create an anonymous Q&A with over 1,000 responses. To share this knowledge, we built a website with the answers, a resource library, and expert insights from Bloody Good Period. By using non-gendered colors and avoiding traditional pinks and reds, the campaign promotes inclusive discussions about the menstrual cycleâ€”not just the period itself.
mainText2: The Period Conversation was a Nice Works project, which encourages the team to explore creative solutions around social issues that we care about. These are self-initiated and self-run passion projects, completed around client work.
