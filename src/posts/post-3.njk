openingText: Nice & Serious worked with the National Landscapes Association to unite the network of Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty under a new, shared brand identity. Part of this brief included building a brand new website using the new identity.
mainText: We built the National Landscapes website on Craft CMS leveraging its powerful Twig templating engine. Craft CMS was selected for its robust plugin ecosystem, robust security, scalability, developer flexibility, and intuitive interface, ensuring seamless management for the client.
mainText2: Following the success of this project, the client has commissioned us to build an additional four websites using the same system for their related brand initiatives.
